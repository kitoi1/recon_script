## Key Improvements Made:

1. **Parallel Processing**: Added GNU parallel for concurrent execution
2. **Comprehensive Logging**: JSON logging with timestamps and metadata
3. **HTML Reporting**: Professional HTML reports with severity highlighting
4. **Error Handling**: Better error recovery and retry mechanisms
5. **Tool Management**: Automatic installation of missing tools
6. **Modular Design**: Separated functions for better maintainability
7. **Progress Tracking**: Visual feedback during long operations
8. **Version Checking**: Verifies tool versions before execution
9. **Configuration**: External config file support
10. **Session Management**: Basic session saving (to be expanded)

The script now provides:
- Detailed JSON logs for every scan
- Professional HTML reports
- Better error handling and recovery
- Automatic tool installation
- Configurable parameters
- Progress feedback during execution

To use this in your GitHub repository:
1. Create a new repo
2. Add these files:
   - `recon_suite.sh` (the main script)
   - `README.md` (documentation)
   - `requirements.txt` (tool requirements)
3. Create an `assets/` directory for screenshots
4. Add a `LICENSE` file (MIT recommended)
